TWEETUMS - an attempt at a lightweight, browser version of TweetDeck
==============================================================================

The reason for writing this, or attempting to write this, is to create a
TweetDeck clone that doesn't use Flash; but rather good old HTML, JavaScript,
and perhaps a dash or [Air](http://www.adobe.com/products/air/) or [Google
Gears](http://gears.google.com/).

I would like to make this different from TweetDeck by building a plugin based
archetecture for creating and maintaining columns.

Also, I don't expect this to work for older version of IE just yet, as I want
to start off by using CSS3 functionality, just to see how much less I could
actually write.
